<h1>I &#x2764; Apache</h1>

<p>In the 90's (of the 20th century that is) I was busy developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture" title="Three-tier architecture is a clientâ€“server software architecture">three tier</a> business applications for deployment on corporate networks. This model was disrupted by the growth of the Internet. The flames underneath this growth were further fanned by the National Science Foundation's decision, in 1991, to lift commercial restrictions on the use of the net. It was obvious to me that I needed to learn some new tricks and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/" title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</a> was at the top of my target list. Fortunately I already had some experience with <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">Linux</a> and before too long <a href="https://www.apache.org/" title="The Apache Software Foundation">Apache</a> appeared in my sight.</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/HTTP_req_resp.gif" alt="http://www.fmc-modeling.org/projects/apache">The structure of HTTP messages (<a href="http://www.fmc-modeling.org/projects/apache" title="Apache Modeling Project">The Apache modeling project</a>).</p>

<p>Looking back it took me over a decade to come to grips with the HTTP protocol and the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" title="Most popular HTTP server on the Internet">server-side implementation</a> of that protocol. In my defense, certainly in the early days, we are talking about fast moving targets and, at the time, documentation, often esoteric, was scattered over the Internet in seemingly endless mailing lists and obscure <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> channels. In 2017 the dust has certainly settled. Nowadays I would qualify Apache's HTTP deamon as a well rounded, mature piece of software. Ever since the introduction of version 2 (2002) quality has been outstanding and changes incremental. First-rate documentation is readily available for multiple audiences at different levels of complexity. The Apache server is very much alive, both from a development and <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server/all" title="Web server usage">adoption</a> perspective, but the main focus of the community has shifted elsewhere (e.g. <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" title="Reliable, scalable, distributed computing">Hadoop</a>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" title="Java-based indexing and search technology">Lucene</a>, ...).</p>

<p>To wrap this post up just a quick mention of a couple of Apache features that never seize to amaze me:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Versatility. The modular nature of Apache makes it possible to achieve some pretty astounding feats. On Unix there is even a choice when it comes to the core of the application, the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mpm.html" title="Multi-Processing Module">MPM</a>. Talking software development my favourite languages, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/developer/modguide.html" title="Developing Apache modules">C/C++</a>, are supported natively but support for other languages (e.g. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-ubuntu-16-04" title="Apache Tomcat">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-apache-and-mod_wsgi-on-ubuntu-16-04" title="Apache and mod_wsgi">Python</a>, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/ruby-on-rails.html" title="Ubuntu server guide, Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>, ...) is excellent as well. Lastly, it's possible to deploy Apache on a wide array of operating systems. The <a href="https://apr.apache.org/" title="Apache APR">Apache Portable Runtime</a>, a brilliant piece of software in and of itself, plays an important role in facilitating this.</li>

   <li>Scalability. In <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/" title="Netcraft, web server market share">Netcraft's Web Server Survey</a> of July 2017 Apache's market share of active sites is 45%. In the same survey Apache's market share of the top million busiest sites is nearly 40%. For me this proves that the Apache HTTP deamon can be used in high traffic scenarios as well as in the long tail of the Internet where the pressure of incoming traffic is much less but other factors, like trouble-free maintenance and running on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+HansdeRooij/posts/6oVjb3vgw5q" title="Apache on a Raspberry Pi">affordable hardware</a>, are more important.</li>

   <li>Community. <a href="https://projects.apache.org/" title="Apache Software Foundation projects">The Apache community</a> is <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/" title="ASF governance">very well structured</a> and <a href="https://projects.apache.org/statistics.html" title="Apache project statistics">vibrant</a>. As mentioned before the HTTP server is now just one of approximately 350 open source initiatives under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.apache.org/" title="Home page of the ASF">Apache Software Foundation</a>. So if you are looking for innovation the ASF is a good place to start.</li>
