<h1>Testing my API Hub v4 dev environment</h1>

<p>In my <a class="blog_prev" href="#" title="A dev environment for my API Hub">previous blog post</a> I created a containerized development environment for my <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v4" title="API Hub version 4">API Hub (v4)</a>. After executing: <code>npm run dev</code>a console log message confirmed that the application was listening on port 3000 but I did not confirm that any further. In this blog post I will executed a couple of in-depth checks to verify whether the application is functioning properly.</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Postman</strong>. In a previous post I already explained why <a class="blog_anchor" href="dev_tools_pt5.html" title="Postman">Postman</a> is an important part of my toolkit. When I develop a new API I always create a collection of HTTP requests while implementing the endpoints. I did this for the most recent revision of my API Hub as well. Because I have shared a <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5a9d3d688a6166c04106" title="API Hub v4 Postman collection">link</a> to the collection it can be imported using standard Postman functionality: <img src="./assets/imgs/pmImpColl.png" alt="Import a link to a Postman Collection"  style="max-width:75%">Please note that, in order for the transactions to work, at this moment, 3 environment variables must be set: <img src="./assets/imgs/pmEnvVars.png" alt="Postman environment variables" style="max-width:85%">With the proper environment specified all test requests worked 100% in accordance with my design: <img src="./assets/imgs/pmGleifTest.png" alt="Gleif test request 👍"  style="max-width:80%">
   </li><li>
      <strong>pgAdmin</strong>. <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/" title="pgAdmin PostgreSQL Tools">pgAdmin</a> is a great tool when working with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL, the most advanced open source relational database">PostgreSQL</a>. In the API Hub v4 <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v4" title="API Hub (v4)">repository</a> PostgreSQL is delivered as a <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v4/tree/main/backend/postgres" title="PostgreSQL Docker container">separate container</a> whereas pgAdmin is part of my local development environment. <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-apt/" title="pgAdmin download &amp; install">Installing pgAdmin</a> on Ubuntu is easy: <div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="f642ebc608d4ae9b5bbf97b211b7347e"></div>Of course a connection to the database must be configured: <img src="./assets/imgs/pgaConnI.png" alt="pgAdmin connection, tab General" style="max-width:65%">and: <img src="./assets/imgs/pgaConnII.png" alt="pgAdmin connection, tab Connection" style="max-width:65%">With a working connection to the PostgreSQL database it is, for instance, possible to execute a SQL query;<img src="./assets/imgs/pgaSqlSelect.png" alt="pgAdmin View/Edit DSata, All Rows" style="max-width:65%">
   </li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">My conclusion, the backend part of the project is working just fine in my containerized development environment!</p>
