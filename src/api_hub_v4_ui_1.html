<h1>Multilingual company names</h1>

<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/dnbdplui" title="D&amp; Direct+ UI">previous implementation</a> of a user interface for <a href="https://www.dnb.com/" title="Dun &amp; Bradstreet">D&amp;B</a> <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/" title="D&amp;B Direct+ documentation">Direct+</a> <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/DataBlocks.html" title="Standard Direct+ Data Blocks">Data Blocks</a> I had made a, what at the time was, fairly complete application for presenting the content of collections of data blocks to non-technical users. However, over a period of twelve months, a lot of <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/html/resources/ChangeHistory.html" title="Direct+ Release Change History">data-elements were added</a> to the API responses. The inclusion of arrays of multilingual company names definitely is one of the most interesting ones though. Moreover, what is great is that these often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram" title="Wikipedia lemma for Logograms">logosyllabic</a> names are, if relevant, included immediately at the lowest level of the <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/DataBlocks.html?apiID=dataBlocks&blockIDs=companyinfo_L1_v1" title="Company Information at level 1">Company Information</a> data block.<img src="./assets/imgs/TSMC.png" alt="Logosyllabic name of TSMC">The seamlessness of the implementation of these names is truly amazing for someone who has struggled with Windows code pages in the past.<img src="./assets/imgs/Samsung.png" alt="Logosyllabic name of Samsung">UTF-8 can basically handle any language you throw at it and is, in a completely unassuming way, the default character set in my entire development toolchain!<img src="./assets/imgs/Oppo.png" alt="Logosyllabic name of Oppo"></p>

<p>I had to make one major implementation decision and that was whether to, if available, implement both the regular and multi-lingual name versions or just choose one of the two. As can be seen from the <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v4/commit/30e24fd8fc32935e505530b3cbf3738c9c77cc3b" title="Commit: added multilingual name arrays">code commit</a> and the screenshot below I opted to, if available, display the multi-lingual names solely and, in those cases where no multi-lingual names are available, revert to the regular name property.<img src="./assets/imgs/multLingualNames.png" alt="Multi-lingual names are the preferred option"></p>
