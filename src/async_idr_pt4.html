<h1>An async HTTP transaction, part 4</h1>

<p>This fourth and last post in the series of blog posts about asynchronous D&amp;B Direct+ identity resolution was a bit of a wait. Luckily I have a couple of good excuses for my tardiness.</p>

   <li>I've been busy reworking my Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js" title="D&amp;B Direct+ prototype">prototype</a>. This work will be the topic of my next blog posts so stay tuned!</li>
</ol>

<p>In my previous post I already explained the ease of working with <a href="https://www.promisejs.org/" title="Promises by Forbes Lindesay">Promises</a> in general and the .then method in particular. The implementation of this method is really straightforward and gives you immediate access to the end result as passed back by the fulfilled Promise. Of course that begs the question what to do in case a Promise is rejected? In these cases the .catch method is applicable. In my <a href="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/76a8d42d69d7259e18c55557d4e462f7" title="Asynchronous Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ identity resolution request">final version</a> of the (standalone) identity resolution code I have implemented additional error handling and a .catch clause to deal with Promise rejection.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Code to trap errors highlighted by HTTP status codes:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="3eb96be0a248229e92e2a683a4f44c61"></div>

<p class="no-indent">Function call returning a Promise including error handling:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="3f0621b485d3d1a227a9b21de1a24cab"></div>

<p>The additional error handling deals with those cases in which the HTTP transaction, from a technical point of view, is successfully concluded but an <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" title="HTTP Status Code Definitions">HTTP status code</a> other than 200 is returned because, for instance, the request submitted is not in accordance with the <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=IdentityResolution" title="D&amp;B Direct+ IDR">API specification</a>. In the first example call both a company name and country are specified: <code>get_1st_mc_name_async({name: 'Agglo', countryISOAlpha2Code: 'NL'})</code> The D&amp;B Direct+ API will be able to generate match candidates based on these search criteria. In the second call however only a name is specified: <code>get_1st_mc_name_async({name: 'Agglo'})</code> Without a valid country code the API will reject the request as can be seen in the screenshot below:</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/idr_async_req_v4.png" alt="Result asynchronous IDR request (incl error handling)"></p>

<p class="no-indent">The screenshot above clearly illustrates that the response to the properly specified request: <code>Name = Agglo-Bouw Voorbeeld B.V.</code> is processed in the .then method of the Promise instance: <code>.then(res => console.log("Name = " + res))</code> Whereas the response to the improperly specified request: <code>Error: Request missing required element: countryISOAlpha2Code (20506)</code> is evidently handled in the .catch clause: <code>.catch(err => console.log("Error: " + err.message));</code></p>

<p>Funny point to note here is that the response to the 1st, properly specified, request is returned after the response to the 2nd request which misses the required country code. Welcome to the world of async programming!</p>
