<h1>The HTML framework</h1>

<p>A couple of years ago my preferred approach to <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/blog/c/" title="SVN repository of hdr.is-a-geek.com">building websites</a> was to develop <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/developer/modguide.html" title="Developing modules for Apache">Apache modules</a>. In 2020 my approach is different. It is just so much easier to either (1) take a serverless approach and push the entire application logic to the client or (2) use <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" title="Node.js is a JavaScript runtime">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" title="Express is a minimalist web framework">Express</a> and <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" title="NGINX is an HTTP &amp; reverse proxy server">NGINX</a> on the server and go a bit lighter on the client side. This GitHub based implementation of my blog is an example of the first approach, my <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v3x" title="API Hub - Request Persist Respond v3x">API Hub</a> project is an example of the second. In its latest iteration my blog&#39;s HTML framework is completely statically defined in the <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/blog/blob/master/index.html" title="My blog&#39;s default page">index.html</a> file located in the root of the code repository.</p>

<p>The starting point for the design of the framework of my previous blog, <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com" title="my previous blog">hdr.is-a-geek.com</a>, was the first version of <a href="https://andreasviklund.com/files/demo/andreas01/" title="A simple &amp; clean multi-layout XHTML/CSS template">Andreas01</a> as developed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viklundandreas/" title="Andreas Viklund on LinkedIn">Andreas Viklund</a>. I still like this design very much and I have invested a lot of time in tweaking it. I personally developed a (more or less) standard <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/xhtml_css/form.html" title="XHTML form basics cheat sheet">HTML form</a> to go along with the template and also <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/test/js_css.html" title="JavaScript CSS scripting">experimented</a> with dynamically switching certain CSS properties on and off. In short, even after all these years, I am still a big fan and I therefore decided to port the overall design to this version of my blog as well. One major issue definitely is that the template predates the concept of a <a href="https://web.dev/responsive-web-design-basics/" title="Responsive web design basics">responsive web design</a>. This is a to-do which is on my radar for sure if only because Google <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html" title="mobile-first indexing">penalizes</a> websites with a non-responsive design.</p>

<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" title="HTML Living Standard">HTML5</a> introduces the concept of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" title="HTML Semantic Elements">semantic elements</a>. In my blog&#39;s framework I use the following semantic elements;</p>

<ul>
   <li>header, which contains the following div&#39;s;<ol class="list_compact">
      <li>URL</li>
      <li>quote</li>
      <li>banner</li>
   </ol></li>
   <li>nav, which contains the menu div</li>
   <li>article</li>
   <li>footer, which contains the following div&#39;s;<ol class="list_compact">
      <li>contact</li>
      <li>dedication</li>
      <li>legal</li>
   </ol></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">The article element is the node in the HTML framework where the <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/blog/tree/master/src" title="Blog posts in the GitHub repo">blog posts</a> will be displayed;</p>
<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/article_tag.png" alt="The article element in HTML" title="The article tag is where blog posts will be displayed"></p>

<p class="no-indent">Property elemArticle of the navigation object contains a permanent reference to this node;</p>
<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/article_ref.png" alt="Property elemArticle" title="Property elemArticle of my blog&#39;s navigation object"></p>

<p class="no-indent">The article reference is used each time the reader navigates to a different blog post;</p>
<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/article_content.png" alt="Switching articles" title="The article element is updated when another post is requested"></p>
