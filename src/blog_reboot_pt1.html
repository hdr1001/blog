<h1>Blog reboot</h1>

<p>It has been quiet on my blog for some time but, believe me, I've been working very hard. Looking back on the past couple of months it's easy to explain the absence of new posts. My <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">previous post</a> is all about deploying my <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/" title="SVN repository of my Dockerized Node.js app">Dockerized Node.js application</a> on my laptop. At an earlier date I had already deployed the same code in a <a class="blog_anchor" title="Docker Compose up-n-running" href="dkr_compose_pt5.html">cloud container</a>. These projects convinced me that I had successfully Dockerized my entire Node.js stack. Having come to this conclusion it was my intention to move on by (<a class="blog_anchor" title="IDR UI, evaluating match candidates" href="idr_ui_pt5.html">further</a>) developing the application's user interface. As part of the journey I wanted to explore how far vanilla HTML-CSS-JavaScript would take me but, even after going the extra mile, I had to admit that this plan was just too time consuming. I'm therefore currently investing part of my time to learn <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="A JavaScript library for building UIs">React</a>. I'm aware that this will probably turn out to be a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap/master/roadmap.png" title="React developer roadmap">long and winding road</a> but please stay tuned for some (hopefully) interesting posts reIated to UI/React deveIopment.</p>

<p>While struggling with the vanilla HTML-CSS-JavaScript code I realized that I had to update the <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/test/javascript.html" title="JavaScript cheat sheet">JavaScript notes</a> I made a couple of years ago. Over time I've become a better JavaScript developer and now I'm very much aware that, even though the language might share certain constructs with languages I've used before (primarily C &amp; C++), it is a completely different beast altogether. I therefore reread "<a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do" title="JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (6th Edition)</a>" by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-flanagan-77b6b45b" title="David Flanagan">David Flanagan</a> and made extensive notes on <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" title="JSFiddle, my humble JavaScript playground">JSFiddle</a>;</p>

<p>What remains to be done is to make a JSFiddle explaining the new ES6 (i.e. ECMAScript 2015) language features. To be quite honest I don't know if I'll ever get around to this because Luke Hoban already created an excellent <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features" title="Luke Hoban, ECMAScript 6 features">GitHub repository</a> dedicated to this particular subject.</p>
