<h1>International IDentity Resolution</h1>

<p>This weekend I revisited my blog posts (<a class="blog_anchor" title="D&amp;B IDR UI, pt. I" href="idr_ui_pt1.html">I</a>, <a class="blog_anchor" title="D&amp;B IDR UI, pt. II" href="idr_ui_pt2.html">II</a>, <a class="blog_anchor" title="D&amp;B IDR UI, pt. III" href="idr_ui_pt3.html">III</a>, <a class="blog_anchor" title="D&amp;B IDR UI, pt. IV" href="idr_ui_pt4.html">IV</a> &amp; <a class="blog_anchor" title="D&amp;B IDR UI, pt. V" href="idr_ui_pt5.html">V</a>) about the <a href="https://bit.ly/2xvfu9O" title="React vs. Plain JavaScript">vanilla JavaScript</a> <a href="https://bit.ly/3gAhuzq" title="D&amp;B Direct+ IDentity Resolution documentation">D&amp;B IDentity Resolution</a> <a href="https://bit.ly/3gncFJq" title="Vanilla JS D&amp;B D+ IDR">user interface</a> I developed one and half years ago. In <a class="blog_anchor" title="D&amp;B IDR UI, part IV" href="idr_ui_pt4.html">part IV</a> of this series I list the functionality an IDR UI should support and state that " ... all this functionality is now available". From a high level perspective this is a true statement but I can vividly remember that, at the time, I was <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/hdr1001/og5x2ns1/" title="Fiddle GOV.UK country autocomplete">desperately looking</a> for a re-usable vanilla JavaScript type-ahead component for specifying a country code. My inability to find such a component convinced me that it was time to start learning a <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="React a JavaScript library for building user interfaces">JavaScript UI framework</a>. I took on a couple of other projects before, in April 2020, I started on <a href="https://bit.ly/33jTkVC" title="React developer roadmap">my journey</a> to learn <a class="blog_anchor" title="Getting started with React" href="react_pt1.html">React</a>.</p>

<p>By now I have converted my entire vanilla JavaScript codebase to <a href="https://bit.ly/2TTSoC4" title="React based UI for my API Hub">React</a>. One of the benefits of switching to React is that comes with a huge collection of reusable, open source licensed components. At this stage I am not ready to commit to one of the larger frameworks like <a href="https://material-ui.com/" title="React components for faster &amp; easier web development">Material-UI</a> or <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" title="The most popular front-end framework rebuilt for React">Bootstrap</a> but it is possible to find excellent individual components as well. I chose <a href="https://github.com/moroshko" title="Misha Moroshko's GitHub user page">Misha Moroshko</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest" title="React WAI-ARIA compliant autosuggest component">Autosuggest</a> as a starting point for the purpose of developing a control which helps a user select a valid <a href="https://bit.ly/2CXQESA" title="ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a> country code. I already posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hdr1001_react-ui-prototype-activity-6692103253385113600-Jg39" title="LinkedIn post about my CodeSandbox prototype">LinkedIn</a> about my <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/react-country-autosuggest-pli9x" title="React country Autosuggest">CodeSandbox.io</a> adventures with this control.</p>

<p>I'm happy to report that I have concluded the prototyping phase and have successfully incorporated the control in my API Hub UI code.</p>

<p>I took away two lessons while integrating the prototype code in my API Hub UI; (1) if you wonder whether you should lift state you probably should and (2) moving everything related to the country data to a separate file really cleaned up my code.</p>
