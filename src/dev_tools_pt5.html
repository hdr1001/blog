<h1>Setting up my dev environment, Postman</h1>

<p>I am in the business of using and building APIs. It should therefore come as no surprise that <a href="https://www.postman.com/" title="Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs">Postman</a> occupies a pretty prominent place in my toolbox. I am aware of the fact though that alternatives do exist:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Like so many I started testing APIs using <a href="https://www.soapui.org/open-source/" title="SoapUI by Smartbear">SoapUI</a>. SoapUI is still around and still is a great tool but, as its name suggests, its focus for a long time solely was on <a href="https://smartbear.com/blog/soap-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/" title="SOAP vs REST. What's the Difference?">SOAP</a> and the application basically contained no facilities for testing REST APIs. For me that opened the door to Postman.</li>
   <li>Lately I've seen a lot of hype surrounding <a href="https://rangav.medium.com/thunder-client-alternative-to-postman-68ee0c9486d6" title="Thunder Client, a lightweight alternative to Postman">Thunder Client</a>. Nice thing about this <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="VSC, code editing. Redefined.">Visual Studio Code</a> extension is that it is build right into my <a class="blog_anchor" href="dev_tools_pt4.html" title="Microsoft VSC">favourite code editor</a>. However I doubt whether this tool will cover all my needs. For now I have decided against making an immediate switch but I am definitely keeping an eye on the further development of this API client.</li>
</ul>

<p>Postman excels, in my opinion, in the area of sharing predefined <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/">collections</a> of API calls. I usually just right-click the relevant three dot menu and choose "Share collection": <img src="./assets/imgs/PostmanShare.png" alt="Share a Postman collection">I then share using a JSON link: <img src="./assets/imgs/PostmanShareJSON.png" alt="Share as JSON link">Please be aware though that anyone who has the link can access the collection and, if you are not careful, secrets (for instance credentials) can end up publicly available on the Internet.</p>

<p>Installing Postman is easy, just <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" title="Download Postman">download</a> the 64-bit Linux file from the Postman website and execute: <code>sudo tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/Postman-linux-x86_64-X.X.X.tar.gz -C /opt</code>For more information go to the <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/" title="Postman's online learning center">Installing and updating</a> chapter on Postman's online learning center. It contains a dedicated section on <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#installing-postman-on-linux" title="Installing Postman on Linux">Linux</a>.</p>
