<h1>I &#x2764; Digital Ocean</h1>

<p>I've been using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" title="Cloud computing, designed for developers">Digital Ocean</a> for years now. Overall my experience has been very good but especially when it comes to creating prototypes I tend to rely on so-called droplets. There are alternatives, like installing Linux on an older PC, creating VMs, etc. but the ease-of-use of just spinning up a new Ubuntu instance in the cloud is unrivalled. The animation captured in the GIF below basically goes through all the steps needed to get an <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/server" title="Ubuntu server">Ubuntu Server</a> environment ready for play.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Besides ease-of-use other strong points of Digital Ocean are:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Value for money. I must confess that I've never bothered to read the <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr> of the Digital Ocean services. The only things I know are (1) that I can't remember a single time I wanted to access my droplets but, for whatever reason, wasn't able to and (2) that, even though I tend to buy small server instances, I consider my boxes pretty responsive. Anyway, this combined with a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing"  title="Detailed Digital Ocean pricing information">monthly bill</a> of a little over &euro;10,- is a good deal in my book.</li>

   <li>Active user <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/" title="Digital Ocean Community">community</a>. This might even be Digital Ocean's strongest point. In my experience, if you want to experiment with new technology you need to jump through a number of hoops to get to the point where you can actually start exploring the topic at hand. For me, particularly in these situations, Digital Ocean user community write-ups have proven themselves to be invaluable time savers. One article succinctly explains how to get from a bare bones server system to your point of departure as opposed to having to browse through numerous search results generated in multiple <a href="https://www.google.com" title="Google">Google queries</a>.</li>

   <li>Amsterdam datacenter. I am personally in favour of strong data protection and data privacy laws. On these topics the EU leads the way. As an EU citizen I therefore have a preference to host my sites in the EU. For me Amsterdam has the added advantage that it is, geographically, really close. This probably reduces the number of hops between the computer I am working on and the datacenter. Because of Digital Ocean's global footprint I can, if I ever develop a site which is popular in say the Far East, always choose to create a droplet in the Singapore datacenter.</li>
