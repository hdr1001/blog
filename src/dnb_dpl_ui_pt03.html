<h1>Reading a D&amp;B Data Block product</h1>

<p><a class="blog_prev" title="Previous blog post">Yesterday</a> I added a file selector control to my project. Today I wrote the code to actually read the file specified by the user. In this code the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader" title="">fileReader component</a> plays an important part. <img src="./assets/imgs/fileRdrCode.png" alt="fileReader code"></p>

<p>I would qualify the code above as classic JavaScript, (1) instantiate an object, (2) execute an async method on the object and (3) handle the method results in an event handler function. The code is constructed pretty defensively with a try-catch block guarding against parse errors and a check for the <i>organization</i> property which is common to all Data Blocks. The DUNS and the primary name of the entity in question are displayed in an alert box when the Data Block JSON is successfully read &amp; parsed. <img src="./assets/imgs/CIFileRead.png" alt="Company Info read &amp; parsed"></p>

<p>Agglo-Bouw is a completely fictitious company. To download the Company Info level 1 Direct+ Data Block for this company either execute; <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdr1001/dnbdplui/main/assets/data/CI_L1_407809623.json --output ~/Documents/temp/CI_L1_407809623.json</code> or click on <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdr1001/dnbdplui/main/assets/data/CI_L1_407809623.json" title="CI_L1_407809623.json">this link</a> and save the page as plain text.</p>
