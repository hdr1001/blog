<h1>Running Apache in a container</h1>

<p>People familiar with my blog will know that my preferred development stack consists of the following components:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Linux (<a href="#" title="Install Ubuntu 18.04" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'ibm_t430_pt2.xhtml')">installed on a PC</a> or <a href="#" title="Digital Ocean Droplet" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'platform_pt1.xhtml')">in the cloud</a>)</li>
   <li><a href="#" title="Apache, my preferred HTTP server" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'platform_pt2.xhtml')">Apache</a></li>
   <li><a href="#" title="PostgreSQL, my RDBMS of choice" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'platform_pt5.xhtml')">PostgreSQL</a></li>
   <li><a href="#" title="Node.js, JavaScript on the server" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'ibm_t430_pt4.xhtml')">Node.js</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It was my intention, when I was writing my <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">previous blog post</a>, to only containerize the Node.js component of this stack. The YouTube video below changed my mind though:</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://www.youtube.com/v/Qw9zlE3t8Ko" width="448" height="252">
   <param name="frameborder" value="0" />
   <param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" />
</object></p>

<p>My goal now is to containerize the entire development stack using Docker Compose (of course, with the obvious exception of the Linux operating system). In this blog post I will make a first, small step towards my overall objective by replicating, in a Docker container, the Apache functionality described <a href="#" title="Constructing the platform, install Apache" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'platform_pt2.xhtml')">here</a>.</p>

<p>Up until now I have uploaded all code associated with my blog to this <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/" title="D&amp;B Direct+ Node.js prototypes">SVN repository</a>. The thing is that the structure of the code base is not optimal for creating a containerized stack. I have therefore decided to create a <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/" title="Containerized Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ code repository">brand new repository</a>. This new repository will only contain the core Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ code. Please note that not porting the other prototypes in no way implies that these are no longer relevant. It is simply indicative of my desire to be laser-focused on constructing a containerized Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ application in the cloud.</p>

<p>The structure of the <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/?p=1" title="v1 new repository">first version</a> of the new repository is very simple: (1) the root directory contains a copy of the <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/LICENSE-2.0?p=1" title="v1 new repository">Apache open source license</a> and a subdirectory apache2 and (2) subdirectory <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/?p=1" title="Subdirectory apache2">apache2</a> contains the Dockerfile for the implementation of a containerized version of my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/" title="The Docker hub Apache repository">favourite HTTP daemon</a> and the subdirectories <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/conf/?p=1" title="Subdirectory conf">conf</a> and <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/static/?p=1" title="Subdirectory static">static</a>.</p>

<p>The fabrication of my initial Apache container image was a breeze with the above-mentioned directory structure in place and the Docker software <a href="#" title="Getting started with Docker" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'docker_pt1.xhtml')">already installed</a>. With directory apache2 as my current directory, I just:</p><ol><li>Created a new text file named Dockerfile and added a single instruction: <code>FROM httpd:2.4-alpine</code></li><li>Next I built the image by issuing the command: <code>docker build -t $USER/apache2 .</code></li></ol>

<p>Upon completion of the image build a container could be created &amp; run: <code>docker run --name dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx -dit -p <i>&lt;port&gt;</i>:80 $USER/apache2</code></p>

<p>At this point I was able to access the containerized Apache instance on the port specified: <img src="/dev/blog/imgs/a2_ctnr_works.png" alt="It works!" /></p>

<p>A quick peek at the Docker log: <code>docker logs dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx</code>revealed that, on startup, Apache could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name. In order to remedy the issue I copied the main configuration file out of the running container: <code>docker cp dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx:/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf ./conf</code>and edited it: <code>vim ./conf/httpd.conf</code>I know from experience that a valid ServerName directive in file httpd.conf will resolve the issue. The configuration file which I copied out of the container already contains a so-called remarked version of this directive. I therefore just updated the ServerName entry in the configuration file to: <code>ServerName dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx:80</code>Of course, the updated version of file httpd.conf will only impact the container if it is included in the container image. To accomplish this the following line must be added to the Dockerfile: <code>COPY ./conf/httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf</code>In order to effectuate the changes I rebuilt the Docker image: <code>docker build -t $USER/apache2 .</code>Before I could rebuild &amp; restart my Apache container, I had to stop the running version of the container: <code>docker stop dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx</code> and remove it: <code>docker rm dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx</code>Finally, based on the new image, I could rebuild &amp; restart my container: <code>docker run --name dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx -dit -p <i>&lt;port&gt;</i>:80 $USER/apache2</code>A second peek at the log file confirmed that the startup issue was now resolved.</p>

<p>To conclude this post there was one more change I wanted to make. In order to replace the out-of-the-box included default page, I created my own, <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/static/index.html?p=1" title="">new default page</a>. Besides writing the HTML code, I had to add this line to the Dockerfile: <code>COPY ./static/index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs</code>and, again, rebuild the Docker image, stop &amp; remove the running container and create &amp; start a new container.</p>

<p>If you have access to a PC or a cloud instance with <a href="https://do.co/2PiQda4" title="How To Install and Use Docker">Docker</a> &amp; <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/" title="Subversion is an open source VCS">Subversion</a> installed it is not necessary to go through all the steps listed above. In that case it is sufficient to execute these 4 commands to create a Docker image and, subsequently, create &amp; run an Apache Docker container:</p>

<p>Replace, in order for this to work, the appropriate value for <i>&lt;port&gt;</i> and make sure this port is open!</p>
