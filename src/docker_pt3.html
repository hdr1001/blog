<h1>HTTPS on my Apache container</h1>

<p>In my <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">previous post</a> I managed to get Apache up-n-running in a Docker container. Of course, the configuration was extremely basic. In this post my goal is to enable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</a>. Obviously, in the grand scheme of things, this just constitutes a <a class="blog_anchor" title="Constructing the platform, implement SSL" href="platform_pt3.html">next step</a> in my project to containerize my entire development stack.</p>

<p>A SSL server certificate &amp; the accompanying private key are required to enable the HTTPS protocol on an Apache server. In this blog post I will not go into detail about how to create these files. Instead I will just briefly touch on the following two options:</p>

<ul>

   <li>In an earlier post I described <a class="blog_anchor" title="Constructing the platform, implement SSL" href="platform_pt3.html">how to</a> create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate" title="Self-signed certificate">self-signed certificates</a>. Please be aware though that, without the proper security exceptions set on the client, browsers will issue a warning whenever such a certificate is encountered. Often times these warnings cause great confusion in the user community.</li>

   <li>Nowadays I prefer to use SSL certificates issued by <a href="http://bit.ly/2E9OnTM" title="A free, automated &amp; open CA">Letâ€™s Encrypt</a>. In order to acquire a certificate I link a <a href="https://dyn.com/remote-access/" title="Dynamic DNS">DynDNS</a> hostname to the IP address of my cloud instance. I then install <a class="blog_anchor" title="Constructing the platform, install Apache" href="platform_pt2.html">Apache</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q5Gcya" title="An easy-to-use automatic client that fetches and deploys SSL/TLS certificates">Certbot</a> directly onto that same instance. From here on out the instructions on the Certbot site are self-explanatory but it is important to note that, in this particular case, I run the bot with option certonly: <code>sudo certbot --apache certonly</code>If all goes well directory /etc/letsencrypt/live/host.example.org/ will contain the files fullchain.pem &amp; privkey.pem. In the Docker container these files can be used as, respectively, server.crt &amp; server.key.</li>

</ul>

<p>Before moving on to a step-by-step account of my implementation efforts, I just want to mention that the instructions below are, in essence, the same as those in the SSL/HTTPS section on the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" title="Docker Hub">Docker Hub</a> <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/" title="The Apache HTTP Server Project">HTTPD page</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing I did in order to enable HTTPS on my containerized Apache server was to make a couple of edits in file <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/conf/httpd.conf?p=2" title="main Apache HTTP server configuration file">httpd.conf</a>. So, using <a href="https://www.vim.org/" title="Vim - the ubiquitous text editor">vim</a> and with directory <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/" title="Directory apache">apache2</a> as my current directory, I executed: <code>vim ./conf/httpd.conf</code>In the text editor I unremarked the following lines in the configuration file to enable SSL related modules (<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_socache_shmcb.html" title="shmcb based shared object cache provider">mod_socache_shmcb.so</a> &amp; <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html" title="Strong cryptography using the SSL and TLS protocols">mod_ssl.so</a>) and activate a reference to file <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html" title="Apache SSL configuration">httpd-ssl.conf</a>:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="57057bc0ca97ab3aaf27f2023c102096"></div>

<p class="no-indent">Next I copied the <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/conf/httpd-ssl.conf?p=2" title="httpd-ssl.conf">SSL configuration file</a> out of the running container:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="abd00ac27ecab4ca8696951f831baf3a"></div>

<p class="no-indent">In the SSL configuration file I changed the ServerName directive to: <code>ServerName dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx:443</code></p>

<p>I added the line below to the Apache <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/Dockerfile?p=2" title="Apache container Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> so as to make the SSL configuration file part of the Docker image:<code>COPY ./conf/httpd-ssl.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf</code></p>

<p>At this stage the SSL keys come into play. File <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/conf/httpd-ssl.conf?p=2" title="SSL configuration file">httpd-ssl.conf</a> contains references to (1) the server certificate file &amp; (2) the associated private key file:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="f8fe83f8216fb5b8e49c2a9afe309b19"></div>

<p>Evidently Apache must be able to access these files when the container is run. For this reason I renamed my SSL keys (more above) to server.crt &amp; server.key and copied them to a new <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/SSL/" title="Directory for SSL keys">directory SSL</a> which is a subdirectory of directory apache2. To make the keys part of my Apache Docker image I added this line to the Dockerfile as well: <code>COPY ./SSL/* /usr/local/apache2/conf/</code>For obvious reasons directory SSL <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/86049/how-do-i-ignore-files-in-subversion" title="How do I ignore files in SVN?">is empty</a> in the project's SVN repository.</p>

<p class="no-indent">With all these changes in place the time had come to rebuild my Apache Docker image: <code>docker build -t $USER/apache2 .</code></p>

<p class="no-indent">Because the container was already running I had to stop: <code>docker stop dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx</code>and remove it: <code>docker rm dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx</code></p>

<p class="no-indent">Finally I could rebuild &amp; restart the container: <code>docker run --name dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx -dit -p <i>&lt;port&gt;</i>:443 $USER/apache2</code></p>

<p>I must confess that I was a bit disappointed when starting the container only resulted in an error message in the log: <code>docker logs dnb_dpl_a2_rvs_prx</code>However, I quickly discovered that I was not the only one with issues starting mod_ssl in this particular setup. In the <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/httpd/issues/115" title="mod_ssl does not start">GitHub issue log</a> I found a remark stating " ... will temporarily use 2.4.35-alpine ... ". This seemed to me to be a workaround worthy of testing so I changed the Dockerfile command: <code>FROM httpd:2.4-alpine</code>to <code>FROM httpd:2.4.35-alpine</code>basically reverting from (Alpine) Apache version 2.4.37 to 2.4.35.</p>

<p>There is no getting around rebuilding the image, stopping &amp; removing the running container and, finally, rebuilding &amp; restarting the container but this time around everything worked like a charm! In my browser I could now open URL: <code>https://localhost:<i>&lt;port&gt;</i></code></p>
