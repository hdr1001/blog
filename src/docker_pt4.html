<h1>SSL client authentication</h1>

<p>I agree, the title of this post is a bit of a <a class="blog_anchor" title="Constructing the platform, SSL client authentication" href="platform_pt4.html">deja vu</a>. The big difference with what I accomplished previously is of course that, this time around, I will implement SSL client authentication on an Apache Docker container.</p>

<p>In case you want to tag along and quickly get to the point where I was when I started work on this blog post, you can, on a PC or cloud instance with <a href="https://do.co/2PiQda4" title="How to install &amp; use Docker">Docker</a> &amp; <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" title="Subversion is an open source version control system">Subversion</a> installed, execute the following commands:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="f79ea12f6c71851f8b7ab1fb61c90a8c6454ee5a"></div>

<p class="no-indent">These instructions will create &amp; run an <a class="blog_anchor" title="Running Apache in a container" href="docker_pt2.html">Apache container</a> with <a class="blog_anchor" title="Dockerized Apache incl. HTTPS" href="docker_pt3.html">SSL enabled</a>.</p>

<p>I will kick off the the discussion of this post's main topic with a reminder that a successful client authentication TLS handshake requires both a valid CA (i.e. Certification Authority) &amp; client certificate: <img src="./assets/imgs/tls_handshake.png" alt="TLS handshake"></p>

<p>On my server I could immediately get started with generating the needed certificates because it came with <a href="https://www.openssl.org/" title="A robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the TLS and SSL protocols">OpenSSL</a> pre-installed. This can easily be verified by executing the command: <code>openssl version</code>Ubuntu 18.04 comes standard with OpenSSL version 1.1.0g.</p>

<p>Assuming that the server already supports <a class="blog_anchor" title="Dockerized Apache incl. HTTPS" href="docker_pt3.html">HTTPS</a>, the process of creating the client authentication certificates can be broken down into the following four steps:</p>

<ol>
   <li>The creation of a directory containing a couple of subdirectories and supporting files which will be used as a working directory. <a href="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/3010dbbe549707520a19984245d46af5" title="Create an OpenSSL working directory">Click here</a> for a complete list of the relevant commands on Github.</li>
   <li>Making a single change to the OpenSSL configuration file: <code>vim openssl.cnf</code>Update the dir entry in section CA_default to ./ <img src="./assets/imgs/openssl_ca_def.png" alt="OpenSSL default directory"></li>
   <li>Certification authority is required in order to be able to produce client certificates. Luckily, in the context of issuing client certificates, it is possible to <a href="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/acfc52cc39e344723d6fd9e26e49b6a3" title="Create certification authority certificate">bestow this authority upon yourself</a>.</li>
   <li>Last step is the creation of one or more <a href="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/3ef7fe72ea2e5eba926b3c2a3afed124" title="SSL client certificate creation">client certificate(s)</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="no-indent">It goes without saying that, once created, the certificates must be installed. Therefore:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Copy the CA certificate to directory SSL (which is a subdirectory of working directory apache2): <code>cd dnb_dpl_v2/apache2</code><code>cp &lt;~/OpenSSL/certs&gt;/myCA.crt ./SSL/CA.crt</code>The Dockerfile contains an instruction to copy all available certificates from directory SSL to container directory /usr/local/apache2/conf.</li>
   <li>For the install of the client certificate your mileage may vary. Below a sequence of screenshots related to installing a SSL client certificate on Firefox. <img src="./assets/imgs/ff_install_clnt_cert.gif" alt="Install client SSL certificate on Firefox"></li>
</ol>

<p>One last thing to do before the client authentication functionality can be tested is to make a couple of changes to file httpd-ssl.conf. <code>vim ./conf/httpd-ssl.conf</code></p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="e9f904ae874aa7a4f5c306dde15f68f0"></div>

<p class="no-indent">Naturally an <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/static/dnb_index.html" title="Default HTML file for directory dnb">index file</a> for directory dnb is needed as well.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Edit the <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnb_dpl_v2/apache2/Dockerfile?p=3" title="The Dockerfile contains build instructions for a Docker container">Dockerfile</a> to make file dnb_index.html part of the container: <code>vim Dockerfile</code></p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="b3e5aa51bf8f14f3d5cc736770247b3d"></div>

<p>As always, in order to test the cumulative changes, you got to do your <a href="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/9b1a27681b577ec9691ca0aef380f06f" title="Docker chores commands">Docker chores</a>. If all goes well you will be able to request: <code>https://host.example.org:<i>&lt;port&gt;</i>/dnb/</code></p>

<p>Please make sure (1) the required port(s) is/are opened on the machine hosting the running container, (2) to replace the correct port number for the placeholder in the URL above and (3) to select the correct client certificate when prompted by your browser.</p>
