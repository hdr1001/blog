<h1>A skeletal Node.js web service</h1>

<p>After doing the groundwork in my two previous blog posts (<a class="blog_anchor" title="Hosting the web services on a VM" href="pltfrm_on_vm.html">here</a> &amp; <a class="blog_anchor" title="Move the D&amp;B Direct+ prototype code" href="mv_dnbdpl_code.html">here</a>), I was now ready to start developing my custom D&amp;B Direct+ IDR (i.e. <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/docs/apis/identity-resolution/versions/1" title="Identity Resolution Overview">identity resolution</a>) web service in Node.js. Of course I was determined to use the Node.js <a href="https://expressjs.com/" title="Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js">Express</a> library given my positive past experiences. I decided to use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp" title="HTTP Methods: GET vs. POST">HTTP POST method</a> for my custom web service, even though the original is a GET, and that was going to be a first for me.</p>

<p>I don't want to sound incredibly old but, at the end of the day, the big story is how easy this all is nowadays. I've implemented C code for parsing URL encoded content before (see <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/cheat/c/a2_utils_hdr.c" title="Parse a URL encoded HTTP POST body in C">here</a>, function parse_post_body) but the comparable, out-of-the-box available code in Node.js is as simple as:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="29a9053162bd190976314e163f76ca4b"></div>

<p>With the input parameters parsed I could shift my attention to adding a new POST endpoint. Again, especially in skeletal form, extremely easy:</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="0a905f134583567ab941a04f514d6760"></div>

<p>Basically just (1) create a JavaScript object, (2) set an HTTP response header and (3) return the previously created object, in JSON format, in the HTTP response body. Please note that the returned object contains the values of two input parameters: req.body.name &amp; .countryISOAlpha2Code.</p>

<p>It was now time to run the code and test the web service: <code>nodejs dnb_dpl_ws.js</code></p>

<p>With the web services up-n-running I initiated the following HTTP POST transaction using curl:</p>
