<h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
<p>I started this blog to share information about my, mostly technology related, voyages of discovery. I've used <a href="https://plus.google.com" title="Google+">Google+</a> for this purpose before but it doesn't suit me very well because it's <a href="https://plus.google.com/+HansdeRooij/posts/HKWXqnKK1wx" title="Why the strike through?">not standards compliant</a>. Added advantage of using my own infrastructure is that I'm able to apply a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Creative Commons">content license</a> of my own choice.</p>

<p>Even though Google wasn't able to conquer the world with their social media ventures I still use Google+ every once in a while to share some <a href="https://plus.google.com/+HansdeRooij/" title="Personal stuff">personal stuff</a>. In my opinion the platform remains an easy-to-use alternative which allows users to make lightweight information available on the net quickly. I use <a href="https://twitter.com/H_de_Rooij" title="Me on Twitter">Twitter</a> primarily to vent about my own <a href="https://twitter.com/H_de_Rooij/status/735000688753823745" title="Parking in RDam :-(">1st world problems</a> and to follow professionals who tweet about topics which interest me. On <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/hdr1001" title="Me on LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> I have a (largely dormant) professional presence.</p>

<p>This blog is privately hosted from my own home. It never seizes to amaze me that I can contact a very simple Intel NUC situated immediately besides my fuse box even when I'm, for instance, on holiday in Greece.</p>
