<h1>1st run, pt. I</h1>

<p>I have made the JavaScript for my D&amp;B Direct+ prototype part of my <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" title="Subversion, an open source version control system">Subversion</a> <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/cheat/" title="My cheat sheets repository">cheat sheets</a> repository. The shortest route to the code is therefore, in language familiar to people working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" title="Source control">revision control systems</a>, to just check it out. For this you will need Subversion:

<code>apt-get install subversion</code>

</p>

<p>With Subversion installed I was able to check out the code. I didn't want to do this as root though. I want to run the code as user dnb_dpl and for that reason, as root, I performed a simulated initial login of user dnb_dpl:

<code>sudo -i -u dnb_dpl</code>

</p>


<p>Next I created a directory dev in the home directory of user dnb_dpl and checked out my cheat sheets to subdirectory cheat.</p>

<div class="ghgist" data-ghgistid="1efe3bcd91eeaa344699abe34177610c"></div>

<p>I now was able to take a peak in the files, for example:

<code>vim ~/dev/cheat/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js</code>

</p>
