<h1>A React form hosted on GitHub</h1>

<p class="no-indent">Over time I have created numerous, cheat sheet like forms. For example:</p>

<ul>
   <li>A very basic <a href="https://hdr1001.github.io/cheat-sheets/html/form.html" title="HTML4 form">HTML4 form</a>,</li>
   <li>A similar, table based, basic <a href="https://hdr1001.github.io/cheat-sheets/xhtml/form.html" title="XHTML form">XHTML form</a>,</li>
   <li>A <a href="https://hdr1001.github.io/cheat-sheets/xhtml_css/form.html" title="CSS styled form">CSS styled</a> XHTML form,</li>
   <li>React based forms hosted on <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/hdr1001/q2oyvbt0/" title="React based Fiddle">JsFiddle</a> and <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/react-form-basics-lifted-state-x9fsz" title="React based CodeSandbox form">CodeSandbox</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I was learning <a class="blog_anchor" title="Getting started with React" href="react_pt1.html">React</a> I got in the habit of using code playgrounds like <a class="blog_anchor" title="Getting started with React, forms" href="react_pt2.html">JsFiddle</a> and <a class="blog_anchor" title="Getting started with React, forms" href="react_pt3.html">CodeSandbox</a> but the emergence of <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> changed all that. Having a local development environment which includes <a class="blog_anchor" title="Setting up my dev environment, VSC" href="dev_tools_pt4.html">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer" title="Live Server VSC extension">Live Server</a> extension installed makes creating a lightweight, proof of concept type of project extremely easy. <img src="./assets/imgs/live_server_ext.png" alt="Launch a development local Server">If, at some stage, either version control or online hosting of the project is needed, my go-to nowadays is <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001" title="My GitHub profile"></a>GitHub.</p>

<p>That is how my cheat cheat form ended up hosted on <a href="https://hdr1001.github.io/hdrReactForm101/" title="GitHub hosted form">GitHub pages</a>: <img src="./assets/imgs/gh_react_form.png" alt="React form hosted on GitHub pages">Because this is GitHub it is easy to follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/hdrReactForm101/commits/main" title="Git commits">evolution</a> of the code:</p>

   <li><a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/hdrReactForm101/commit/df3b703edf84672fcfbfd9b99c26ab1609c6652b" title="New repository commit">Initial commit</a> of a new repo on GitHub created using the standard GitHub UI,</li>

   <li>I added <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/hdrReactForm101/commit/f0704316830c19c7d19033daa0d456ea696baa27" title="Hosting my React app on GitHub pages">the code</a> necessary for deploying the form on GitHub pages. For more details just watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/F8s4Ng-re0E" title="How to Deploy React App to GitHub Pages by Telmo Sampaio">Youtube video</a>,</li>
   <li>In the remaining commits you can see how, more or less, one by one the controls are added to the form until, on the 8th of October 2021, I finalized the project.</li>
