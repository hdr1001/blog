<h1>A React Material UI form hosted on GitHub</h1>

<p>Last year I decided I would no longer develop web user interfaces using <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/" title="üòâ">vanilla JavaScript</a>. Instead I invested in learning <a class="blog_anchor" title="Getting started with React" href="react_pt1.html">React</a>. As a first practical exercise I ported my <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/" title="D&amp;B Direct+">D&amp;B Direct+</a> <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=IDRCleanseMatch" title="D&amp;B Direct+ IDentity Resolution">IDentity Resolution</a> <a class="blog_anchor" title="IDR UI, 1st attempt (100% HTML)" href="idr_ui_pt1.html">vanilla JavaScript</a> user interface to <a class="blog_anchor" title="D&B D+ IDR user interface" href="whitsun_idr_pt2.html">React</a>. Even though, from a purely functional perspective, the front-end worked very well, I thought the design was a bit bland. Of course I could have, at least partially, fixed this issue by investing a lot of time in the project's <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_ui/blob/master/src/components/ahRprIdr.css" title="Just a single style sheet actually">style sheets</a>. Unfortunately web design is  not one of my primary interests. I therefore decided to start using the <a href="https://mui.com/" title="MUI, the leading React UI library">Material UI</a> library. Material UI (aka MUI) provides a robust, customizable and accessible library of foundational &amp; advanced React <a href="https://mui.com/components/" title="All MUI components">components</a>. These components all adhere to Google's <a href="https://youtu.be/rrT6v5sOwJg" title="YouTube, Making Material Design">Material Design</a> <a href="https://material.io/design" title="Material Design">guidelines</a> and therefore, in my modest opinion, just look good.</p>

<p>Before developing a significant project I thought it would be a good idea to test MUI in a smaller, proof of concept like setting. I opted to make a <a href="https://hdr1001.github.io/muiReactForm101/" title="React MUI form">new version</a> of the form that I have used as a template in multiple builds now. For comparison the <a class="blog_anchor" title="A React form hosted on GitHub" href="gh_form_react.html">previous version</a> of the form is <a href="https://hdr1001.github.io/hdrReactForm101/" title="React form (no Material UI)">hosted</a> on GitHub as well.</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/reactMuiForm.png" alt="React & React MUI form compared">‚ÜñÔ∏è React v. React MUI ‚ÜóÔ∏è</p>

<p class="no-indent">Comparing the two final products I noticed how different the dimensions of the forms are. The React form is vertically more compact despite the fact that is has a title and vertically organized radio &amp; option buttons. The React MUI form has more horizontal space, especially for the text input fields.</p>

<p>In my opinion, even without using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" title="Create React apps with no build configuration">create-react-app</a>, constructing a project based on React &amp; Material UI is easy. Just follow the steps listed in my <a class="blog_prev" href="#" title="Previous blog post">previous blog post</a> or track the <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/muiReactForm101/commits/main" title="Project muiReactForm101 code commits">evolution of the code</a> on GitHub. When compared to the <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/hdrReactForm101/commits/main" title="Project hdrReactForm101 code commits">standard React</a> application I added <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/muiReactForm101/commit/4e45113fa6469842990a8168d7f93182197ad31c" title="Project now is a Material UI project">this step</a> (please note the code comments) after step 2 in order to add Material UI. I would qualify the remaining steps as self-explanatory maybe with the exception of <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/muiReactForm101/commit/b0cbbad0c58aac6b3a3a1398c7e4b417b9aa03ca" title="Added Radio control">the commit</a> in which the radio buttons were introduced. In this commit I had to update file webpack.config.js to specify a different loader for svg content.<img src="./assets/imgs/webpackSvgLoader.png" alt="Use a different loader for svg content"></p>
