<h1>My new (second-hand) hardware</h1>

<p>Recently I was invited to bid on leftover laptops my employer decided to get rid of. I let the IT guys know I had a preference to buy a Lenovo from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_Series" title="ThinkPad X Series">Thinkpad X series</a>. I use this model professionally and, although not the most sexy, these machines are sturdy &amp; extremely portable. Unfortunately a lot of my co-workers also love this model and Lady Luck was not on my side this time. So no Thinkpad X for me. No worries though because afterwards I was given the opportunity to purchase a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_T_Series" title="Lenovo Thinkpad T series">T430</a>. The only thing I checked before closing the deal was if I would be able run virtual machines on this hardware. A quick look at the processor's <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/64896/Intel-Core-i5-3320M-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-3_30-GHz" title="Intel® Core™ i5-3320M Processor">spec sheet</a> confirmed that it supported Intel's Virtualization Technology (VT-x) which was all I needed to know.</p>

<p class="no-indent">My T430 came equipped with:</p>

<ul>
   <li>An Intel® Core™ i5-3320M CPU,</li>
   <li>8 GB of DDR3 memory,</li>
   <li>an old-school 320GB 7200RPM HD &amp;</li>
   <li>a 1600×900 TFT color LCD display.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice I was pleasantly surprised by the screen. My laptop has the so-called HD+ display (1600x900 pixels, 250 nits), not the HD one (1366x768, 200 nits). Negative feedback on the Internet regarding the T430 can almost always be traced back to the HD version of the display.</p>

<p>Before installing any software on the laptop I decided to (1) give it a good clean and (2) swap the 320GB HD for a <a href="https://www.kingston.com/us/ssd/consumer/sa400s37" title="Kingston A400 SSD">120 GB SSD</a>.</p>

<p>Because the T series is somewhat larger than the X series disassembly is relatively easy. I found these helpful instructions on <a href="https://youtu.be/o2-SN9HPwh0" title="Lenovo ThinkPad T430 disassembly">YouTube</a>. As can be gathered from the picture below cleaning the laptop was not such a bad idea:</p>

<p>Swapping the hard drive proofed to be very easy. My new 2.5 inch solid-state SATA drive was a good fit &amp; functioned straight out-of-the-box.</p>
