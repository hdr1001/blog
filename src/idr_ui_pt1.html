<h1>IDR UI, 1st attempt (100% HTML)</h1>

<p>In my previous three blog posts I (1) wrapped <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=IDRCleanseMatch" title="Identity Resolution">D&amp;B's Direct+ IDentity Resolution</a> functionality in a <a href="#" title="D&amp;B IDR JavaScript object code" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'idr_ws_pt1.xhtml')">JavaScript class</a>, (2) <a href="#" title="Add persistence to object DplIDR" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'idr_ws_pt2.xhtml')">added persistence</a> to this class &amp; (3) connected the object logic to <a href="#" title="Custom web service for class DplIDR" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'idr_ws_pt3.xhtml')">custom web service endpoints</a>. While developing this code I did all my testing in a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" title="Mozilla Firefox">Firefox</a> add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/restclient/" title="RESTClient, a debugger for RESTful web services">RESTClient</a>. Of course, in real life, IDentity Resolution functionality is often used by end users to lookup a company on the D&amp;B database. In these scenarios a User Interface is needed. The development of such a UI, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a>, will be the subject of my next series of blog posts.</p>

<p>My plan for the first implementation of the user interface was simple; recycle some of the <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/xhtml_css/basics.html" title="My cheat sheets">cheat sheet code</a> I developed a couple of years ago and, from there, just stick to the age-old adagium <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" title="KISS principle">"keep it simple, stupid"</a>. In practice this last bit meant <i>no client-side JavaScript code</i> (at least not in v0.1).</p>

<p>Effectively I took the following steps to get to a working UI:</p>

<ol>
   <li>I checked out my <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/xhtml_css/form_v2.html">tableless XHTML form</a> from the publicly available <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/cheat/xhtml_css/" title="HTML test page">cheat sheet repository</a> and incorporated it into <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/ui/test_page.html?p=14" title="HTML test page">my project</a>. Of course I had to rework the code. The most important changes I made were (1) I deleted (or hid) a bunch of input elements, (2) I changed the values associated with the for, name &amp; id attributes of the label &amp; input elements to reflect the <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=IDRCleanseMatch" title="D&amp;B Direct+Identity Resolution">query string parameters</a> of the Direct+ IDR call and (3) I updated the form tag's method &amp; action attributes. Please note that, in this first version, the country code parameter is fixed to NL in a hidden input field.</li>

   <li>Besides the <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/xhtml_css/form_v2.html">tableless XHTML form</a> I also made the accompanying <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/css/hdrcheat_form_v2.css">cascading style sheet</a> part of my project. I just copied the file, renamed it to <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/ui/" title="D&amp;B IDR form style sheet">dnb_frm_idr.css</a> and, using a link tag, created a reference to it in the header section of the test page.</li>

   <li>In my <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_ws.js?p=14" title="My customized web services">Express code</a> I added two new endpoints, one for the HTML test file &amp; one for the style sheet:<script src="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/1e589510df1c49b96454c230074be24c.js" type="text/javascript"></script></li>
</ol>

<p>With all this in place I could request the HTML UI, fill out search criteria &amp; submit the IDentity Resolution request. I recorded one of my tests using <a href="https://github.com/phw/peek" title="Animated GIF screen recorder">Peek</a> to produce the gif below:<img src="/dev/blog/imgs/idr_html_ui.gif" alt="HTML UI in action" />.</p>

<p>In this quick &amp; dirty initial implementation submitting the form returns the JSON as generated by the D&amp;B Direct+ API. A few attributes of the first match candidate in the HTTP response can be gathered from the following screenshot:<img src="/dev/blog/imgs/idr_html_ui.png" alt="JSON IDR reponse" /></p>

<p>In case you are wondering, DUNS 40-780-9623 is a D&amp;B test record.</p>
