<h1>IDR UI, evaluating match candidates</h1>

<p>In my <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">previous post</a> I explained the reasons why, in my opinion, my <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/ui/dnb_frm_idr.js?p=18" title="Fully functioning IDR front-end">JavaScript user interface code</a> for <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=IDRCleanseMatch" title="D&amp;B Identity Resolution cleanseMatch">D&amp;B identity resolution</a> had reached such a maturity level that it could be considered a fully functioning front-end. Of course, in this case, "fully functioning" by no means implies "best-in-class". In order to take the implementation further in that direction I will, in this post, add a couple of lines of code to help the end-user pick the right match candidate. In order to achieve this I leverage additional match candidate attributes as returned by the API and make them an integral part of the UI. Please refer to <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/html/guides/Identify/IdentityResolution.html" title="Direct+ Identity Resolution Guide">this excellent guide</a> on the D&amp;B Direct+ website for more information about these additional attributes.</p>

<p>So these are the relevant code changes together with an example of their user interface impact:</p>

<ol>
   <li><i>Branch records.</i> It's important that an end-user is aware of the fact that he or she is about to assign a DUNS of a branch record because, in some use cases, branch records are not as relevant as in others. This is the JavaScript to distinguish branch candidates:<img src="./assets/imgs/idr_mcs_branch_code.png" alt="Distinguish branch records in code"> ... with this visual impact for the end-user:<img src="./assets/imgs/idr_mcs_branch.png" alt="Visual representation of a branch record"></li>
   <li><i>Out-of-business records.</i> In almost all use cases end-users will prefer active match candidates over OOB ones. It's therefore important to highlight out-of-business records. In code I recognize OOB match candidates as follows:<img src="./assets/imgs/idr_mcs_oob_code.png" alt="Distinguish OOB records in code"> ... adding the class has the following visual effect:<img src="./assets/imgs/idr_mcs_oob.png" alt="Visual representation of an out-of-business record"></li>
   <li><i>Trade style matches.</i> Sometimes a match is made on a trade style name instead of the primary name. This can be confusing for the end-user. For this reason having a visual clue that a trade style match was made is helpful. The Match Data Profile (MDP) can be used to bring these kinds of matches to the fore:<img src="./assets/imgs/idr_mcs_ts_code.png" alt="Distinguish trade style matches in code"> ... now, for those cases in which a match was made on a trade style name, the name of a match candidate will be shown in italics:<img src="./assets/imgs/idr_mcs_ts.png" alt="Visual representation of a trade style match"></li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that there is further room for improvement. Other valuable additional attributes could be, for instance, an indication of a particular match type or the MDP codes which indicate a match on a former address. Anyway, in case you are interested in the version of the code in which these changes were first implemented, <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/ui/dnb_frm_idr.js?p=18" title="Fully functioning IDR front-end">click here</a>. As always the most recent version of my entire SVN <a href="http://bit.ly/2OKuOWM" title="D&amp;B Direct+ Node.js code repository">code repository</a> is available on the Internet as well.</p>
