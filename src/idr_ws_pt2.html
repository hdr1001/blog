<h1>D&amp;B IDR persistence</h1>

<p>This blog post is all about adding persistence to my <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/" title="D&amp;B Direct+ API">D&amp;B Direct+</a> <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=IdentityResolution" title="D&amp;B Direct+ Identity Resolution">IDentity Resolution</a> (IDR for short) <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js/?p11" title="Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ object code">object code</a>. In summary I took three steps to add this functionality to class DplIDR: (1) I created the required database structures, (2) I developed the additional Node.js code and (3), to conclude, I performed a limited number of tests. Below you will find more information about the implementation details of each of these steps.</p>

<ol>
   <li><i>Database structures</i>. If you read <a href="#" title="Unleash JSON in Postgres" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'l_halliday_blog.xhtml')">my blog</a> regularly it should come as no surprise that <a href="#" title="Web service, conclusions" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'ws_run_pt4.xhtml')">I love the JSONB data type</a>. This data type was first introduced in <a href="#" title="Web service, conclusions" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'postgresql_rdbms.xhtml')">PostgreSQL</a> version 9.4. For storage purposes both the IDentity Resolution input parameters (field parameters) and the Direct+ end result as returned by the API (field result) are defined as database columns of type JSONB. Column http_stat saves the HTTP status code which is part of the Direct+ REST response. Especially when error conditions occur it can be very helpful to have recorded to this data-element. Column id is a so-called auto increment field. It provides a unique, numeric primary key value for each row of data.

Please note, all the SQL statements associated with the required database structures which support my D&amp;B Direct+ object code can be found at the end of the JavaScript file <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js" title="Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ object code">dnb_dpl_objs.js</a>.
   </li>

   <li><i>Node.js JavaScript object code</i>. From an application logic point of view the IDentity Resolution transaction is persisted in two parts: (1) the input parameters are saved when the IDR REST request is initiated and (2) upon return of the match results the JSON body of the HTTP response is written to the database in conjunction with the HTTP status &amp; a timestamp. The first function is actually executed in parallel with the D&amp;B Direct+ API request and, as such,  provides an excellent opportunity to program a  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all" title="Aggregate the results of multiple promises">Promise.all</a>:

In the snippet above the operative functions, from a persistence perspective, are: (1) dplIdrParamsToDB and (2) dplIdrResultsToDB. For more details click <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js/?p11" title="Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ object code">here</a>.
   </li>

   <li><i>Testing the code</i>. In my <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">previous blog post</a> I already explained that I love being able to code this statement: <code>let oIDR = dpl.getIDR({name:'Agglo', countryISOAlpha2Code:"NL"});</code>A very similar line of code can be found near the top of my IDentity Resolution test procedure (see function <a href="http://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_test.js" title="Node.js D&amp;B Direct+ object code test procedure">after_ini_code_2()</a>):

In the test code I not only instantiate an object of class DplIDR but also acccess a couple of instance properties and even drill down a bit further into the JSON object returned by the D&amp;B Direct+ API.

The entire IDR transaction is written to the database because, with the latest additions, the JavaScript class now contains persistence functionality as well:
