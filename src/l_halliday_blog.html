<h1>Unleash JSON in Postgres</h1>

<p>One reason for me to start this blog was reading <a href="https://blog.codeship.com/author/leighhalliday/" title="Leigh Halliday">Leigh Halliday's</a> excellent article <a href="https://blog.codeship.com/unleash-the-power-of-storing-json-in-postgres" title="Storing JSON in Postgres">Unleash the Power of Storing JSON in Postgres</a>. The article describes the solution to a problem I wanted to solve for some time now and my favorite <acronym title="Relational Database Management System">RDBMS</acronym>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="My favorite RDBMS">Postgres</a>, plays a pivotal role in getting to the solution.</p>

<p>The problem I wanted to solve is explained clearly in the article: &quot;<cite>Maintain data that comes from an external service in the same structure and format (as JSON) that it arrived to you as. What ends up in the database is exactly what the API provided</cite>&quot;. In my professional life the &quot;external service&quot; is of course <a href="https://docs.dnb.com/direct/plus/en-US/index" title="D&amp;B Direct+">D&amp;B Direct+</a> and the <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> referenced is represented by the <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> responses. These tend to be quite complex and flattening the JSON objects for storage in database tables is rather tedious and will likely generate noise. Being able to store the JSON data as delivered and, moreover, being able to index and query such data is a huge leap forward.</p>

<p>For me, an old dog who wants to learn new tricks, but who doesn't want to throw away everything he has learned in the past, it's extremely attractive to be able to combine my knowledge of storing data in a RDBMS while, at the same time, having the opportunity to leverage more modern, document oriented approaches. PostgreSQL's <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html" title="Postgres JSON data types">JSONB</a> data type has the potential to be the enabling technology which makes this all possible.</p>

<p>After reading Leigh Halliday's article I couldn't wait to spin up an <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/server" title="">Ubuntu server instance</a> on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" title="Cloud computing, designed for developers">Digital Ocean</a> to create a prototype to explore the concepts mentioned above.
