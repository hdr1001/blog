<p>At the end of 2020 there was a lot of hype surrounding the release of AMD's Ryzen 9 line-up of CPUs. After decades of using Intel chips I thought it would be fun to build a new, AMD based, PC. I didn't want to pay much more than ‚Ç¨500,- though. In 2021 that meant playing the waiting game.</p>

<p>After the summer prices finally came down far enough for me to justify my purchase. I decided to pair up my new <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-5900x" title="AMD Ryzen 5900X">AMD Ryzen 5900X</a> with a <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550-VISION-D-P-rev-1x#kf" title="Gigabyte B550 Vision D-P">Gigabyte B550 Vision D-P</a> motherboard. A huge improvement when compared to my previous PC, which, at its core, had an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75122/intel-core-i74770-processor-8m-cache-up-to-3-90-ghz/specifications.html" title="Intel i7-4770">Intel i7-4770</a> CPU. My trusty i7 was slotted into the 1150 socket of an <a href="https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-maximus/rog-maximus-vii-ranger-model/" title="Asus Maximus VII Ranger">Asus Maximus VII Ranger</a> motherboard. But what does this all mean in practice?</p>

<p>You might be wondering, but what about the GPU? 2021 was a crazy year for GPU prices. Just look at the price development of, what should be a reasonably priced graphics card, the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 Super OC 6G ‚¨áÔ∏è.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/imgs/GeForceGTX1660Pricing.png" alt="2020 - 2021 GeForce GTX 1660 Super pricing"></p>

<p>Because I'm neither a gamer nor a crypto miner, this is not for me. I therefore settled on a ‚Ç¨90,-, passively cooled, <a href="https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Graphics-Cards/ASUS/GT1030-SL-2G-BRK/" title="ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5">ASUS GeForce GT 1030</a> which works really well for my purposes. If I were to buy this same card today it would set me back ‚Ç¨110,- which is just ü§™.</p>
