<p>I decided to build a new PC to get my hands on some proper 2021 hardware goodies. For the foundation of my previous PC I screwed an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75122/intel-core-i74770-processor-8m-cache-up-to-3-90-ghz/specifications.html" title="Intel i7-4770">Intel i7-4770</a> on to a <a href="https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-maximus/rog-maximus-vii-ranger-model/" title="Asus Maximus VII Ranger">Asus Maximus VII Ranger</a> motherboard. My new PC is based on an <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-5900x" title="AMD Ryzen 5900X">AMD Ryzen 5900X</a> processor which is slotted into the the AM4 socket of a <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550-VISION-D-P-rev-1x#kf" title="Gigabyte B550 Vision D-P">Gigabyte B550 Vision D-P</a> motherboard. But what does this all mean in practice?</p>

<ol>
   <li>Whereas my previous CPU had 4 cores and 8 threads, my new CPU has 12 cores and 24 threads. Moreover, each individual AMD Ryzen 9 core has much more processing power.</li>
   <li>The memory installed on my previous system was 16GBs of DDR3 memory (@667MHz), the new build has 32GBs of DDR4 memory (@3600MHz).</li>
   <li>Where I used to have 2 SATA(3) based SSDs with a combined capacity of 500GB, I now have 2 M.2 cards (one of which is PCIe) with a combined capacity of 2TB.</li>
   <li>Because I bought the Gigabyte B550 Vision <i>D-P</i> version of my motherboard it has Thunderbolt 3, dual 2.5GbE LAN, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.</li>
   <li>The entire package is nice and compact so I can make due with a much smaller case. Where I opted for the really big <a href="https://www.custompcreview.com/reviews/cm-storm-stryker-case-review/" title="Cooler Master Stryker">Cooler Master Stryker</a> last time around, I chose the more modest white Be Quiet! Pure Base 500DX this time.</li>
