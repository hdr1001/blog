<h1>I &#x2764; Node.js</h1>

<p>When building a web application my go-to move is to use C to create an <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/test/a2mod_cbasics.html" title="My C cheat sheet as an Apache module">Apache module</a>. In a <a class="blog_anchor" href="apache_httpd.html" title="Apache, my preferred HTTP server">previous blog post</a> I already explained why Apache is my favourite HTTP server. Versatility is definitely one of Apache's strong points and modules play an important role in achieving this. A number of modules come as <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/" title="Predefined Apache modules">part of the server distribution</a> but, if you're slightly more ambitious and know how to program either C or C++, creating your own, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/developer/modguide.html" title="Developing modules Apache">customized modules</a> is relatively <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/cheat/c/apr_002_min_html_mod.c" title="Minimal Apache module">simple</a>. This blog actually is an <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/blog/c/a2blog_main.c" title="Blog C code">Apache module</a> with a bit of client-side <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/blog/js/a2blog_main.js" title="">JavaScript code</a> bolted on.</p>

<p>Why would I even consider <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/" title="About Node.js">Node.js</a> when I am so enthusiastic about Apache modules? The answer is threefold:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Prototyping. In my experience, when you start work on a C project, it's probably best to do some thinking &amp; designing first. You can only start coding upon conclusion of this phase. This is not my preferred approach when prototyping. Usually, when prototyping, I instantly want to test a couple of high-level concepts. For me the best way to accomplish this is to write &amp; run some bare bones code. Node.js is very helpful in these circumstances because (1) it's extremely easy to get the JavaScript run-time environment <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04" title="Set up Node.js on Ubuntu">ready for play</a> on Ubuntu, (2) JavaScript code is interpreted so there is no need to compile after each code change and (3) the availability of all kinds of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-npm-to-manage-node-js-packages-on-a-linux-server" title="How to use npm">high quality libraries</a> allows you to move fast.</li>

   <li>Technology. Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment with an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. Everything is aimed at enhancing throughput. I can definitely see the rationale behind this design choice, especially in the case of web applications. When I first started writing Node.js code I was surprised at how much, as a developer, you are forced into this asynchronous way of thinking. This might sound negative but it is, in practice, very helpful. It all makes perfect sense once you get the hang of it.</li>

   <li>JavaScript. One of my claims to fame is that I've read the <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do" title="JavaScript: The Definitive Guide">Rhino book</a> cover to cover. Initially my goal was to make my web application's client interface <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/test/js_dom.html" title="JavaScript Document Object Model">more interactive</a>. At the time I already concluded that JavaScript has a <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/test/javascript.html" title="Previous JavaScript write-up">surprising depth</a> to it. A whole new dimension is added to this assessment by being able to use this programming language on the server as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't won't to give away too much about what comes next but, as a teaser, I can already let you know that, even though I had high expectations when I set out on my journey to implement D&amp;B Direct+ using Linux(/Ubuntu), Node.js and PostgreSQL, this combination performed, in more than one way, even better than I had expected.</p>
