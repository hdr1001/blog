<h1>Constructing the platform, pt. IV</h1>

<p>My <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">previous blog post</a> dealt with the basics of SSL(/TLS), i.e. the required certificates and the configuration of my Apache web server. As a last step I requested a minimal HTML page using the secure version of the HyperText Transfer Protocol.</p>

<p>When a connection, comparable to the one in the example above, is initiated, several messages are exchanged between the client &amp; the server in order to establish an encrypted channel for secure communication. As part of this protocol, the so-called <a href="https://goo.gl/YSLpkN" title="Simple TLS handshake">TLS handshake</a>, the client authenticates the server’s identity by verifying the supplied server certificate. The server, however, is under no obligation to authenticate the identity of the client and, in most common usage scenarios, does not do so. But, although unusual, the server can insist, as part of the TLS handshake, on <a href="https://goo.gl/pTDHAr" title="Client authenticated handshake">client authentication</a>. The protocol can therefore be used to identify users and to control access to the server. On the one hand this method of authenticating users is more complex than prompting users for their assigned user-id &amp; password because issuing, installing and managing certificates is, especially when the user community grows, a huge logistical and administrative challenge but, on the other hand, certificates provide strong protection and, once installed on the client, are extremely easy to use. Considering these pros and cons I decided a long time ago that SSL client authentication is an excellent method for restricting access to my prototypes deployed in the cloud but it’s good to know that if, for whatever reason, this method of securing access to an application is not applicable, Apache is extremely flexible and has a lot tricks up its sleeve when it comes to <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html" title="Apache authentication and authorization">authentication &amp; authorization</a>.</p>

<p>To implement SSL client authentication I first edited the Apache SSL configuration file:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/79b03d80f53d44ea75d2d995edddc618.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuthVerify.png" alt="Default no SSL client verification" />Default is no client authentication</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuthCaCert.png" alt="CA certificate verification" />Reference the certification authority's certificate</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuth_dnb.png" alt="Location dnb SSL client verification" />Force client authentication on directory dnb</p>

<p>Next I copied the certification authority's certificate to the designated directory, created minimal content and restarted the server:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/2db38f17ff6824f3066048dc4c49c314.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Client configuration (FireFox in the example below) proved to be simple. Please note that the CA certificate was <a class="blog_prev" href="./prev" title="Previous blog post">already installed</a>.</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuthCertMan.png" alt="Firefox certificate manager" />Import the client certificate in the browser</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuthFF.png" alt="User identification request" />When accessing the secured page confirm the client certificate</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuthSecurePage.png" alt="Access granted to secure page" />With the certificate installed the page can be viewed</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/ClntAuthChrome.png" alt="No secure connection ..." />No valid certificate, no access</p>
