<h1>Hosting the web services on a VM</h1>

<p>I've been busy over the last couple of weeks and therefore there hasn't been much time to add content to my blog. My next project is to add D&amp;B <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/" title="D&amp;B Direct+ developer portal">Direct+</a> <a href="https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/docs/apis/identity-resolution/versions/1" title="D&amp;B Direct+ IDR">identity resolution</a> functionality to my custom web services. First order of business was the creation of a development platform because I pulled the plug on my <a class="blog_anchor" title="I love Digital Ocean" href="digital_ocean.xhtml">Digital Ocean</a> <a class="blog_anchor" title="Constructing the platform, pt. I" href="platform_pt1.xhtml">prototype</a> some time ago. This time around I wanted to set up a Ubuntu server <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine" title="Kernel-based Virtual Machine">virtual machine</a> to host my Node.js web services. So, over the last couple of weeks, whenever time allowed, I've been busy with the construction of a new (virtual) development environment. For this purpose I use my Ubuntu desktop machine. It already had the necessary virtualisation software installed. At the time, if memory serves me well, I think I used <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/117635/how-to-install-kvm-and-create-virtual-machines-on-ubuntu/" title="How to Install KVM and Create Virtual Machines on Ubuntu">this article</a> on How-to Geek as an installation &amp; getting started guide. Once I had my virtual Ubuntu server (<a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server" title="Download Ubuntu Server">v16.04</a>) up-n-running I just followed the instructions in my own blog, <a class="blog_anchor" title="Constructing the platform, pt. II" href="platform_pt2.xhtml">starting here</a>, to get to the same point as where I left off my initial, cloud based prototype. I'm glad that I can report there were no surprises and, as a result, the port to the new environment went very smoothly.</p>

<p>Of course I made a snapshot of my new point of departure. For instructions on how to create such a snapshot please refer to the <a href="https://youtu.be/nqQ8ksHffOA" title="Using Snapshots in Virtual Machine Manager">YouTube</a> video below.</p>
