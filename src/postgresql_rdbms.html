<h1>I &#x2764; PostgreSQL</h1>

<p>Data persistence is part of the scope of nearly every software project in which I am involved. Nowadays there are multiple technologies and, often times, multiple implementations of these technologies which can be employed to deliver the mechanics of this particular part of the solution. I must confess though that I have a couple of strong preferences in this area of software development. First of all, I'm partial to well thought-out, normalized and relational data models. This might sound self-evident but I've seen my fair share of projects struggling with exactly this part of the total solution. Secondly, I understand there are <a href="https://goo.gl/kCo3yP" title="Motives of NoSQL practioners">valid motives</a> for switching to a NoSQL approach but I've always been able to solve the challenges with which I was confronted using traditional Relational DataBase Management Systems. In this regard I think it's important to note that, over the years, these systems have evolved and, for instance, in recent releases, include <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype-json.html" title="PostgreSQL JSON data types">features</a> that used to be associated with, what once was, the specialty category of document-oriented databases.</p>

<p>Even when taking all of the above stated preferences into consideration, my choice for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/" title="About PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a> is by no means obvious. There are a lot of open &amp; closed source alternatives out there. In cases where, at the end of the day, I can deliver the scope of a project using solely open source components, I'm inclined to do so. In this category the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking" title="Database engines ranking">two clear front-runners</a> are PostgreSQL and <a href="https://mariadb.org/about/" title="MariaDB Foundation">MariaDB</a><a href="https://www.mysql.com/" title="MySQL, the most popular open source database">(/MySQL)</a>.</p>

<p>The first time I had to choose between these two open source alternatives must have been somewhere between 2000 and 2010. I know this because one of my requirements at the time was the availability of FOREIGN KEYs. This concept has been a part of PostgreSQL ever since release 7.0 (in 2000) and has only been a standard part of MySQL since release 5.5 (in 2010) when the InnoDB storage engine was made the default storage engine. The easy, out-of-the-box availability of FOREIGN KEY functionality swayed me on that occasion and, because my experience working with PostgreSQL was excellent, it has been my preferred option from that moment on.</p>

<p>In the years after my initial decision I watched from the sidelines as MySQL entered quite a turbulent period in its existence. In 2005 <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/innobase/index.html" title="Announcement acquisition Innobase">Innobase OY</a>, the developer of the InnoDB storage engine, was acquired by Oracle. This cast a shadow over MySQL's long term viability and open source credentials. The issue was resolved in 2006 when MySQL AB, MySQL's parent company, and Innobase OY signed a new multi-year license agreement. In hindsight this skirmish is probably best interpreted as a round of opening shots being fired. In 2008 MySQL AB was bought by Sun Microsystems and in 2009 Sun Microsystems was, in turn, scooped up by Oracle. In all this turmoil one of the founders of MySQL decided to create a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html" title="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>-only fork of MySQL, MariaDB. For me this move saved MySQL as a credible open source alternative. Having said that, as a satisfied PostgreSQL user, I want to reiterate that I feel very much at home with my liberally licensed, community owned RDBMS.</p>

<p>After more than three decades of development PostgreSQL is a powerful and feature rich database. Nonetheless the community is still very active and focused. This is illustrated exceptionally well in the PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/" title="PostgreSQL feature matrix">feature matrix</a>. Release 9.2 was released some 5 years ago. In the feature matrix you can select version 9.2 and the versions which came after it. This provides a perfect overview of the functionality added in this timeframe. In my modest opinion a major achievement especially when considering the maturity of the project. By the way, the feature which recently caught my attention, <a class="blog_anchor" href="l_halliday_blog.html" title="Leigh Halliday's blog">the JSONB datatype</a>, is on the list. It was first made available in release 9.4 (in 2014).</p>
