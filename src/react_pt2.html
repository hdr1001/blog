<h1>Getting started with React, forms</h1>

<p>For me webforms are the primary means to make websites interactive. I find webforms challenging though. Of course, nowadays, especially with Node.js on the server, slapping together a couple of controls, submitting the content to a server and persisting the data is easy. Having said that, coding a form which (1) users like to interact with, (2) looks pretty (and does so on multiple browsers) and (3) has proper validation is a completely different matter. My <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/xhtml_css/form.html" title="XHTML form cheat sheet">first attempt</a> at coding a form goes way back and the project relied heavily on an HTML table for structure &amp; organization. The <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/dev/cheat/xhtml_css/form_v2.html" title="XHTML form with CSS layout">2nd implementation</a> of the same form was based on more advanced CSS concepts and no longer relied on HTML table elements. Please note that both versions were based almost entirely on (X)HTML and extremely light on JavaScript.</p> 

<p>Considering the above it should come as no surprise that, when I read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html" title="React forms">chapter on forms</a> in the React documentation, I wanted to make a new, 3rd version of the form but this time on <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/hdr1001/q2oyvbt0/" title="2020 version of my webform">JSFiddle</a>. One of the best features of this code playground is that it is easy to embed the results of your efforts in basically any webpage like this;</p>

<script async="async" src="//jsfiddle.net/hdr1001/q2oyvbt0/280/embed/result/"></script>

<p>The form above uses so-called "controlled components". For me this meant I had to radically change the way I think about how to code a webform but, in the end, I believe I was able to make the transition pretty quickly. The advantage of the React approach definitely is that you have much more control over everything that is going on in your application.</p>
