<h1>Run-up to IDR UI code</h1>

<p>Recently I have created a new version of my <a href="https://bit.ly/3fj3NnS" title="API Hub - Request Persist Respond v3">API Hub</a> repository. I have come a long way since the <a href="http://bit.ly/2OKuOWM" title="Subversion repo of what came to be my API Hub">1st version</a> of the project which, in hindsight, basically was just a collection of Node.js prototypes. The <a href="http://bit.ly/2Ssc7bX" title="Dockerized Dockerized implementation of the D&amp;B Direct+ API">successor project</a> (more or less) contained the same code but Dockerized. In the summer of 2019 I moved the next version of the codebase to <a href="http://bit.ly/2NBvdd6" title="Github repo API hub RPR">GitHub</a>. The code in this repository was significantly better structured and more modular. This allowed me to implement the <a href="https://www.gleif.org" title="Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation">GLEIF</a> <a class="blog_anchor" title="GLEIF data integration" href="gleif_data.html">reference data product</a> in no time. Even though the structure of the code was superior, the way the files were organized in the repository was not. In the end file <a href="http://bit.ly/39ac36C" title="file ah_rpr_objs.js">ah_rpr_objs.js</a> contained several distinct functional parts and more than a 1000 lines of code! This was the main reason behind my decision to create an entirely new <a href="https://bit.ly/3fj3NnS" title="API Hub - Request Persist Respond v3">GitHub repository</a> with an improved file structure.</p>

<p>These are, when compared to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2NBvdd6" title="Github repo API hub RPR">previous version</a> of the repository, the most important changes that I have implemented in <a href="https://bit.ly/3fj3NnS" title="API Hub - Request Persist Respond v3">api_hub_rpr_v3x</a>;</p>

<ol>

   <li>I have removed the Apache container from the project. My current thinking is that a reverse proxy will be part of the infrastructure in which my API Hub will be deployed.</li>

   <li>I have upgraded the (Alpine) Docker container versions of both Node.js (8.12 ‚û°Ô∏è  12.16) &amp; Postgres (10.6 ‚û°Ô∏è  12.2). Consequently I had to change this code; <img src="./assets/imgs/buff_new.png" alt="new Buffer"> to; <img src="./assets/imgs/buff_from.png" alt="Buffer from"></li>

   <li>I moved code from üìÑ <a href="http://bit.ly/39ac36C" title="file ah_rpr_objs.js">ah_rpr_objs.js</a> to;</li>

   <li style="list-style-type: none">üìÑ <a href="https://bit.ly/2SxX5R7" title="Project globals">ah_rpr_glob.js</a>, the project globals file now contains structs linked to the supported APIs, product keys, data products and related utility functions as well.</li>

   <li style="list-style-type: none">üìÑ <a href="https://bit.ly/3b2fzj2" title="Object globals">ah_rpr_glob_obj.js</a>, in the new repository I added this file as the designated storage area for shared object code. At the time of this writing this code is shared by the AuthToken &amp; DataProduct classes but, in the near future, an IDentity Resolution class will leverage the code as well.</li>

   <li style="list-style-type: none">üìÑ <a href="https://bit.ly/2W285by" title="Authorization token">ah_rpr_obj_auth.js</a>, this file contains code dedicated to the Authorization Token class.</li>

   <li style="list-style-type: none">üìÑ <a href="https://bit.ly/3fh3f1L" title="Data product class">ah_rpr_obj_prod.js</a>, this file contains code dedicated to the Data Product class.</li>

</ol>

<p>I think it is interesting to note the circular references in <a href="https://bit.ly/3b2fzj2" title="Object globals">ah_rpr_glob_obj.js</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/2W285by" title="Authorization token">ah_rpr_obj_auth.js</a>. I was able to resolve the resulting complications by;</p>

<ol>

   <li>making the references to the token object instances part of the exports of the shared object code (at end of <a href="https://bit.ly/3b2fzj2" title="Object globals">ah_rpr_glob_obj.js</a>),</li>

   <li>initializing these references in file <a href="https://bit.ly/2W285by" title="Authorization token">ah_rpr_obj_auth.js</a> <img src="./assets/imgs/inst_tokens.jpg" alt="Instantiation of auth tokens"> and</li>

   <li>adding the following statement; <code>const ahObjAuth = require('./ah_rpr_obj_auth.js');</code> as the last line of file <a href="https://bit.ly/3b2fzj2" title="Object globals">ah_rpr_glob_obj.js</a>.</li>

</ol>
