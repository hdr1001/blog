<h1>I &#x2764; Ubuntu</h1>

<p>I can trace my history with Linux all the way back to the early days of <a href="https://www.slackware.com/" title="">Slackware</a>. Just out of interest I would install this distro on outdated hardware and experiment. For a short time I switched to <a href="https://www.suse.com/" title="">Suse</a> but, at the time, my impression was that this <abbr title="Operating system">OS</abbr> was a bit of a resource hog. That's why I gave <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Humanity to others">Ubuntu</a> a try. Ever since I have used Ubuntu on both my <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop" title="Ubuntu for the desktop">desktop</a> and my <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/server" title="Ubuntu for the server">servers</a>. The server version of this OS powers my <a href="http://hdr.office-on-the.net/" title="Ubuntu hosted on Digital Ocean">Digital Ocean droplets</a> in the cloud and is installed on the Intel NUC which I privately own and use to host this blog. Nowadays I tend to stick to the long-term support releases. The software I employ is mature and therefore there is no real need to update more frequently than once every two years.</p>

<p>For me Ubuntu is a platform on which I can develop my projects and prototypes. The software I use to build on this foundation (e.g. <a href="https://apache.org/" title="Apache HTTP Server">Apache</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="The world's most advanced open source database">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js, designed to build scalable network applications">Node.js</a>, ...) can be found in the standard repositories of the OS and therefore a simple:

<code>sudo apt-get install (apache2, postgresql, nodejs, ...)</code>

suffices to retrieve, install and implement the server components. Minimal configuration is usually needed but my aim is always to stick, as close as possible, to the configuration as provided out-of-the-box. From a support perspective it's reassuring to know that, for <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life" title="Long-term support releases">LTS releases</a>, Ubuntu guarantees the availability of security patches &amp; updates for a period of five years.</p>

<p>I briefly want to mention that connecting to Ubuntu server instances over SSH is something I do on a daily basis. Remembering the relevant user-IDs and passwords becomes more and more challenging as the number of servers that you have to support grows. Reusing passwords is tempting but always a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/06/mark-zuckerberg-hacked-on-twitter-and-pinterest" title="Facebook founder looses control over social media accounts">bad idea</a>. I therefore have switched to using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Key_management" title="Secure shell key management">SSH public-private key pairs</a> on all my Linux boxes (this includes my Raspberry PI). In practice this is not only very convenient for authentication purposes but also improves security. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" title="Digital Ocean">Digital Ocean</a> supports SSH keys as a standard feature of their droplets and has produced a couple of good community articles on the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets" title="SSH Keys with DigitalOcean Droplets">subject</a>.</p>
