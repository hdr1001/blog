<h1>Installing Ubuntu 20.04</h1>

<p>If you follow my blog on a regular basis you know I'm big fan of the cloud services provided by <a class="blog_anchor" title="The platform, Digital Ocean Droplet" href="platform_pt1.html">Digital Ocean</a>. However, recently I decided that, from now on, I will work on my personal projects on my Thinkpad <a class="blog_anchor" title="My 2nd-hand Lenovo Thinkpad T430" href="ibm_t430_pt1.html">T430</a> instead. Unfortunately, in March 2020, this laptop still ran on Ubuntu <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/" title="Ubuntu Bionic Beaver">Bionic Bever (18.04)</a>. Usually I'm very conservative when it comes to installing a new OS. I tend to stick with long term releases and only install a new version of the Ubuntu LTS release a couple of months after the official launch. This time around though I opted to give Ubuntu <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/10/the-ubuntu-20-04-lts-codename-has-been-revealed" title="Ubuntu Focal Fossa">Focal Fossa (20.04)</a> a chance in pre-release and I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed!</p>

<p>The upgrade went without a hitch and I love the new look of my desktop (courtesy of GNOME v3.35). The Docker install done <a class="blog_anchor" title="Docker on my T430" href="dkr_compose_t430.html">previously</a> still worked like a charm. Of course I now host my <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr" title="Application Programming Interface Hub">API Hub repository</a> on Github so I have updated my "deploy &amp; run" <a href="https://gist.github.com/hdr1001/1536299d7732087af52919cdfa9c11f9" title="Deploy my API Hub code as a colection of Dockerized containers">gist</a>.</p>

<p>After executing the steps listed above my project started immediately and without a single warning.</p>

<p>Because I just reused my SSL certificates I could request data products straight away.</p>
