<h1>D&amp;B D+ IDR user interface üèÉ</h1>

<p>My first action to get going with the development of a <a href="#" title="Getting started with React, part IV" onclick="navBlog.anchorAction(event, 'react_pt4.xhtml')">React</a> based user interface for <a href="http://bit.ly/2NrDMEw" title="D&amp;B Direct+ documentation">D&amp;B Direct+</a> <a href="https://bit.ly/3gAhuzq" title="D&amp; D+ IDR">IDentity Resolution</a> functionality was the creation of an entirely new <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_ui" title="React based UI for request, persist &amp; respond API Hub (v3x)">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted my <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/min_react_app" title=" Minimal React, Webpack &amp; Babel appliction">minimal React app</a> code to be the starting point for the new project but, at the same time, I did not want a permanent link between the two repositories, so I searched for alternatives to forking. Luckily I came across an article about <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZN0ikm" title="Mirroring a repository">"mirroring a repository"</a> which turned out to be just what I was looking for.</p>

<p>Next I cloned the repository ... <code>git clone https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_ui.git</code> ... and made <a href="https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_ui/commit/86a6666157f21c62adf537ed044216b11204cf17" title="Update the code in repository api_hub_rpr_ui">some changes</a> to reflect the fact that the purpose of the code had changed.</p>

<p>In order to run the code I executed ... <code>npm install</code> ... from the project's root directory. There were some vulnerabilities but those were easily fixed with ... <code>npm audit fix</code> ... and the command above prepared the way for ... <code>npm start</code><img src="/dev/blog/imgs/wp_dev_srvr.png" alt="App run in dev server" /></p>

<p>I wrapped up the session with a quick code commit;</p>
