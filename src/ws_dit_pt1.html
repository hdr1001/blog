<h1>A short diversion, part 1</h1>

<p>So there was a plan but then things changed. The plan was to write a couple of blog posts about the complete overhaul of my <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js" title="Implementation of the D&amp;B Direct+ API on Node.js">D&amp;B Direct+ Node.js object code</a>. What happened was that I was involved in a discussion about mixing &amp; matching data-elements from different D&amp;B APIs and that put me off course. Do not despair though this diversion contains some good stuff as well.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://toolkit-api.dnb.com" title="D&amp;B Data Integration Toolkit">Data Integration Toolkit</a> is D&amp;B's most mature API. Considering its age it should come as no surprise that this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP API</a>. It seems to me that the new generation of coders is very fond of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" title="Representational state transfer">REST</a> whereas people of my age, nearly <a href="https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/population-games/world-population-me/" title="The world population and me">80% of the world population</a> is younger than I am, tend to have a preference for SOAP. In my experience automatically reading a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language" title="Web Services Description Language">WSDL</a> to create objects in code is a great starting point for software development and usually results in robust applications.</p>

<p>Another thing to note about the D&amp;B Data Integration Toolkit is that it still is unique in its ability to deliver a certain set of data-elements. Without a doubt D&amp;B is most commonly known for its <a href="https://www.dnb.com/about-us/our-analytics/predictors-scores-ratings.html" title="Basic Analytic Solutions">predictive indicators</a>. At the time of this writing, the Toolkit is the only API from which this category of data-elements can be delivered. This uniqueness explains why the Toolkit is referenced so often in discussions about mixing &amp; matching data-elements from multiple sources.</p>

<p>But before implementing this mixing &amp; matching I had to make a couple of architectural choices. The most important of which was whether or not to use any specific Node.js SOAP packages. It was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8655252/node-js-how-to-consume-soap-xml-web-service" title="Node.js: how to consume a SOAP XML web service">a thread on StackOverflow</a> which swayed me to opt for <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/https.html" title="Node.js module which implements the HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL">the standard Node.js HTTPS package</a>. This actually is the same package that I use to implement REST interfaces. The obvious advantages of going with the standard HTTPS package are (1) it's an extremely lightweight option and (2) I'm already familiar with the framework.</p>

<p>Toolkit support does introduce an additional external dependency though. Package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom" title="JavaScript implementation of W3C DOM">xmldom</a> is required in order to support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/introduction.html" title="What is the Document Object Model?">Document Object Model</a> interactions like this:</p>

<p class="img_caption"><img src="./assets/imgs/dit_obj_dom.png" alt="Toolkit object DOM call"></p>

<p class="no-indent">The package can easily be deployed using the JavaScript package manager: <code>npm install xmldom</code></p>

<p>My <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dit_objs.js" title="Node.js implementation of the D&amp;B Toolkit API">Toolkit Node.js object code</a> follows the same implementation pattern as that of the <a href="https://hdr.is-a-geek.com/svn/dnbdpl/node.js/dnb_dpl_objs.js" title="Node.js implementation of the D&amp;B Direct+ API">D&amp;B Direct+ object code</a>. In short, a JavaScript object is created to wrap the API. The object logic is that, whenever a data product for a certain DUNS is requested, a SQL query is launched to try and retrieve the product from the database. If the product is available on the database it will be returned immediately. An online call to the relevant API will be initiated in case the product is not yet available. The product retrieved online will not only be returned but stored on the database as well. Direct+ products are stored on the database as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-json.html" title="PostgreSQL JSON Types">JSONB values</a>, Toolkit products are stored as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-xml.html" title="PostgreSQL XML Type">XML values</a>.</p>

<p>Having the object wrapper at your disposal greatly facilitates web service implementation using the <a href="https://expressjs.com/" title="Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js">Express framework</a>. A function to instantiate Toolkit objects is exported near the end of the JavaScript object code file:</p>
